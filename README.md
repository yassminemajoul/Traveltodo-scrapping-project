# Security-Project
The objective of our scrapping project is to systematically extract structured data from the travel platform traveltodo.tn, specifically focusing on elements such as destinations, pricing,rating and user reviews. The extracted dataset will serve as a basis for analyzing market trends, evaluating pricing dynamics, and understanding promotional patterns within the Tunisian tourism industry.
